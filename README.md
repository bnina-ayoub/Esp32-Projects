Sure, here is a sample README file for a GitHub repository that mentions that you worked on VS Code using the PlatformIO extension and that the three projects are LED blinking, Potentiometer-Based LED Intensity Regulator and a WIFi connected LED Controller with web requests:


# ESP32 Basic Projects

This repository contains my first three basic ESP32 projects. The projects are:

* **LED Blink:** This project blinks an LED connected to the ESP32.
* **Potentiometer-Based LED Intensity Regulator:** This project regulates the intensity of an LED connected to the ESP32 using a potentiometer.
* **The LED Indicator for WiFi Connectivity and Web Interaction:** This project uses HTTP requests made from a web browser and reads data sent from the website using the HTTP GET method.

The projects are written in Arduino and use the ESP32 Arduino library.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects, clone the repository and open the `.ino` file for the project you want to work on.

## Requirements

* ESP32 development board
* VS Code
* PlatformIO extension

## Instructions

1. Install the PlatformIO extension for VS Code.
2. Open the `.ino` file for the project you want to work on.
3. Click the PlatformIO icon in the VS Code toolbar.
4. Select the "Upload" task to upload the code to the ESP32 development board.

## Documentation

The documentation for the ESP32 Arduino library can be found here: https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32

## Note

This project was developed using VS Code and the PlatformIO extension.

## Additional Information

* The LED Blink project uses a simple blinking LED circuit to demonstrate the basics of controlling an LED with the ESP32.
* The Potentiometer-Based LED Intensity Regulator project uses a potentiometer to control the intensity of an LED connected to the ESP32.
* The LED Indicator for WiFi Connectivity and Web Interaction ensures the WiFi connection by turning on the LED and determine if the data was successfully returned or if the page is not found.
